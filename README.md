# wp-for-kustom

This is where I was told to create a json file using 
a template provided by Kustom.rocks. It is linked
to apk files I created using KAPK. It provides the
links to my website where I have uploaded my wallpapers 
designs, digital Artworks and kustom presets, widgets 
and komponents.
